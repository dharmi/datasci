Problem 4
The relationship "friend" is often symmetric, meaning that if I am your friend, you are my friend. Implement a MapReduce algorithm to check whether this property holds. Generate a list of all non-symmetric friend relationships.

You can test your solution to this problem using friends.json:
        python asymmetric_friendships.py friends.json
You can verify your solution against asymmetric_friendships.json.

PRoblem weere left under development - so code does not work yet.



Which State is happiest?

Task description:
Write a Python script, happiest_state.py, that returns the name of the happiest state as a string.
happiest_state.py should take a file of tweets as an input and be usable in the following way:
          $ python happiest_state.py <sentiment_file> <tweet_file>
The file AFINN-111.txt contains a list of pre-computed sentiment score.
Assume the tweet file contains data formatted the same way as the livestream data.

 
As it was recommended that I would build on my solution to Problem 2.

Problem 6: Top ten hash tags

According to the folowing task description:
 
Write a Python script, top_ten.py, that computes the ten most frequently occurring hash tags from the data you gathered in Problem 1.
top_ten.py should take a file of tweets as an input and be usable in the following way:
          $ python top_ten.py <tweet_file>
Assume the tweet file contains data formatted the same way as the livestream data.
Your script should print to stdout each hashtag-count pair, one per line, in the following format:     
          <hashtag:string> <count:float>
